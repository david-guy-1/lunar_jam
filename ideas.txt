ideas : a shooter game

beat each level in 10 seconds ( might be too short to beat an entire level, maybe beat a single phase of a boss in 10 seconds, or a boss that changes attack type every 10 seconds)

make it lunar themed : moon phases cycle every 10 seconds.

maybe some enemies only attack when the moon is a certain phase, or some enemies only spawn at certain phases.

basically , a "global" 10 second cycle controls the game.
