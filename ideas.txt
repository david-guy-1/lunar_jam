ideas : a shooter game

beat each level in 10 seconds ( might be too short to beat an entire level, maybe beat a single phase of a boss in 10 seconds, or a boss that changes attack type every 10 seconds)

make it lunar themed : moon phases cycle every 10 seconds.

maybe some enemies only attack when the moon is a certain phase, or some enemies only spawn at certain phases.

basically , a "global" 10 second cycle controls the game.

however, I want to avoid making a Touhou-style bullet hell shooter game , since it would be too similar to my previous game.

maybe.. the player can only shoot once every 10 seconds, so the player has to carefully choose where to shoot , instead of just spamming shots. That adds some strategic depth to the game

or maybe, alternate between the player attacking and player doing other stuff every 10 seconds.

during the "other stuff" part, the player should get into position to line up shots, etc. maybe also attack in ways other than shooting, such as placing explosives, and then detonating them during the 10 seconds of shooting.

They also said a "top down" shooter, so probably I shouldn't make a platformer or something like that. 



Maybe in the game you only have 10 seconds of oxygen before you need to retreat to your base to replenish your supply. This means that you need to balance your time between fighting off the aliens and making sure you have enough oxygen to survive.

To make things more interesting, you could have different types of aliens with varying attack patterns and weaknesses, as well as power-ups and upgrades that you can collect by defeating certain enemies or exploring the moon's surface.

idea #2:

a game where you manage a society on the moon but every ten seconds is a decade. You try to progress as much as you can and after 5 centuries the game ends.
